This is just a Get-TreeSize function to show (recursively) how much space (files and) folders take up.  I wrote it in a 3hr live-coding session on Floobits as an exercise for the [PowerShell virtual user group](http://PowerShell.slack.com) (for an invite visit http://slack.poshcode.org)

To install:

```posh
Install-Module -Name TreeSize
```

Example usage:
